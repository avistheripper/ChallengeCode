FE part for a task-solution platform:
  requires mongoDB to get data from, and BE part running.
To get things up and running with local BE(actually needs to be re-worked):
 - npm i
 - node server (change MLab account credentials beforehand)
 - npm start and go to localhost:4200
To get started with complete BE:
 - npm i
 - npm start
