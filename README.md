  requires mongoDB to get data from, and BE part running.

 - npm i
 - node server (change MLab account credentials beforehand)
 - npm start and go to localhost:4200
To get started with complete BE:
 - npm i
 - npm start

To be added:
- SPREAD BRANCHES TO PROD and DEV
  - Remove "Code to exec" form leaderboard
  - OAth flow
  - IDE validation (e.g submit button is disabled until code changes)
  - user icon to navbar
  - stat page to be redisigned
  - fix the logic of displaying the result card for the separate task
  - stylings (text-decoration when onhover "Get started")
  - arrow icon role switch
  - loader when IDE is proccessed
